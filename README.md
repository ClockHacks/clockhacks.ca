## About

Finding time for yourself outside of your busy life is critical, especially for high-school / university students, since they are still exploring themselves, their passions, and developing their identity. However, this is not possible if there isn’t enough time, which can be a great challenge for high-school and university students. There’s one thing young students are great at: it’s technology. What if we could use technology to our advantage, to save time?

This is why ClockHacks was created. Our mission is to inspire developers to create innovate solutions for managing time, your most valuable asset. Unlike money, attention, or energy, time is limited; you have no way of getting it back once you’ve used it.
