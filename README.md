## By students, for students

ClockHacks is a hackathon created by a group of high school students from Waterloo, Ontario.

Our mission is to make hackathons accessible and fun for high school students around the world. Themed around time, Clockhacks will take place online on DATE.

You will be able to work in teams of up to 4 to create a website, game, app, robot, or whatever tech-related product you want. Participate in activites, speeches, workshops, and events to learn more about the world of tech. At the end of the event, pitch your project to a panel of judges and compete for prizes.

Join hackers from across North America this November for a weekend of fun and innovation at ClockHacks!
